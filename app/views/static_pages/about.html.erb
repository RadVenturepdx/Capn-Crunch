      <p>After parting ways with her “personal adventure guide” (aka break-up with boyfriend), Andrea felt a large void in her ability to really get out and about to experience the outdoors as she had before.  One day, as she was going for a run, she had an A-HA! moment that she was likely not alone in this feeling of frustration.  What if there were others out there with the desire to see, experience and conquer but they just need a local friend to help show them the way?  That was when Radventure was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’ve all been there. You’re in a rad new place, but aren’t quite sure where to start. You wish you had a local buddy to give you the inside scoop. You chat with ski techs, bike shop staff, and bartenders, but what you really want is local to show you the sick spots so you can make the most your time outside.

          <h3>Andrea Bouma<br>
            <small>Director of Supply Chain Management</small>
          </h3>
          <p>Andrea has always had a love for the outdoors which only grew after her move out west from Michigan 10 years ago.  Activities that she is passionate about include: snowsports, hiking, running, river adventuring, and generally having a good time out in the sun.   Andrea’s background is in systems development from her past life as a product development food scientist.  After completing a MBA in strategy and entrepreneurship from Portland State University, Andrea teamed up with Courtney and Robyn (two of the raddest members of her cohort) to create Radventure.  A nomad at heart, Andrea is stoked to hit the road and work 1:1 with future Radventure guides to create a robust network of people helping people maximize their time having fun in the great outdoors.</p>
